## 1. What went well?
Have each team member  write down what they feel went well 

"Worked as a team well"
"Nice mix of technical people and design people => different skill sets"
"Members learned a lot (Material UI, etc.)"

## 2. What could be improved?
This is about actions and outcomes â€“ not about specific people.

Tough when a few people aren't yet familiar with all prcoesses, using that process and trying to connect things together
when we split off, need to get everyone up to speed
Some people weren't always able to work on project, left gaps in knowledge

## 3. What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint?
Having identified what didn't go so well, what concrete actions can the team take to improve those things? 

people not familiar => take time to go through things and add lots of comments!
people not able to work on project => schedule different time? not work unless everyone there? Catch them up to speed before working?
            => use more of git workflow (liveshare has its downfalls) pushing changes to master copy
we all need to be better at scoping and overall organizational of projects


## Presenting Project

Chris => Step 3 (Checkout)
Daniel => Step 2 (Customer Form)
Ian => Admin page + reducers
Kyle => Step 1 (pizza list)

Major issues: back button (local state of toggle), integrating curentOrder to orders in database (admin)
